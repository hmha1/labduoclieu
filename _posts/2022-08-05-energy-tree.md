Thermoelectric material, which directly converts waste heat to electricity, provides an ecofriendly power generator to reuse heat energy sources. New attempts have started for thermoelectricity of low‐dimensional materials since 1993 when the theory of confinement effect was presented by Hicks and Dresselhaus. Experimental works have been inspired by the theory of confinement to the use of low‐dimensional materials for improving thermoelectric efficiency for more than two decades. However, many people have tried that experimentally, and no one has been quite successful. Therefore, we want to know why and how to solve this issue. It is thus necessary to reevaluate the thermoelectric theory of the low-dimensional materials to find a new and general theory of the thermoelectric enhancement.
