Historically, materials discovery has mostly relied on the Edisonian trial and error approach. However, such a traditional process becomes increasingly time-consuming. With this approach, a material from laboratory to market can take many years and is very expensive. Thus, this project aims to accelerate the exploration, design, and discovery the high-performance and low-cost quantum-materials, such as 2D materials or topological materials, for energy-efficiency applications including thermoelectricity, photocatalysis, low-power electronic devices. We call this is "Energy Tree". 

The integrated approach will combine the DFT calculations and data-driven methods (i.e., high-throughput screening and machine learning). Compared to traditional materials discovery, the integrated approach has the potential to substantially reduce the experimental efforts needed to identify promising materials with target functionalities for the new energy quantum-materials.
