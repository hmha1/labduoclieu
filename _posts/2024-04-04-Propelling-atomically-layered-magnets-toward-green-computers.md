Our collaborative paper in 2D magnetic materials for energy-efficient spintronics was selected by MIT news, Phys.org, etc. with the title ["Propelling atomically layered magnets toward green computers"](https://news.mit.edu/2024/propelling-atomically-layered-magnets-toward-green-computers-0404).

This paper was also highlighted in the newsletter: ["Van der Waals magnet integration for energy-efficient spintronics"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44287-024-00048-3) by Nature Reviews Electrical Engineering.
