We published an open-source code "QERaman: An open-source program for calculating resonance Raman spectra based on Quantum ESPRESSO" by N. T. Hung, J. Huang, Y. Tatsumi, T. Yang, and R. Saito.

This code is designed for computing the first-order resonance Raman spectroscopy based on Quantum ESPRESSO. 

#### Features

1. Electron-photon and Electron-phonon matrix elements
2. Resonance Raman spectra
3. Linearly-polarized light
4. Circularly-polarized light and polar plot
5. Complex Raman tensor

The open-source code can download at [GitHub](https://github.com/nguyen-group/QERaman).
