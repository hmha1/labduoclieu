#### QERaman

An open-source program for computing the first-order resonance Raman spectroscopy based on Quantum ESPRESSO.

>In the QERaman program, the complex values of Raman tensors are calculated based on the quantum description of the Raman scattering from calculations of electron-photon and electron-phonon matrix elements, which are obtained by using the modified Quantum ESPRESSO. Our program also calculates the resonant Raman spectra as a function of incident laser energy for linearly- or circularly-polarized light. The program will be a helpful tool for experimentalists who want a theoretical tool for understanding the observed resonance Raman spectra for a linearly- or circularly polarized light. All codes, examples, and scripts are available on the GitHub repository.
